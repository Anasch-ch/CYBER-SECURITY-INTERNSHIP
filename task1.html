<p>Penetration Testing Task 1 Report: Local Network Port Scan</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Objective The objective of this task was to scan the local
network to discover open ports on devices, understand network exposure,
and identify potential security risks associated with the open
ports.</p></li>
<li><p>Tools Used Nmap — Network scanning tool to perform TCP SYN
scan.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Wireshark (optional) — Packet capture and analysis tool.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Environment Operating System: Kali Linux (running in bridged
mode)</li>
</ol>
<p>Network Interface: eth0</p>
<p>Local IP: 192.168.67.195/24</p>
<p>Network Range Scanned: 192.168.67.0/24</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Methodology Identified the local network IP range using ip a
command.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ran the Nmap TCP SYN scan with the command: nmap -sS 192.168.67.0/24
-oN local-scan.txt</p>
<p>Captured network packets during the scan using Wireshark on interface
eth0.</p>
<p>Analyzed open ports and services found.</p>
<p>Researched common services running on those ports and potential
security risks.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Scan Results Total IPs scanned: 256 (192.168.67.0 to
192.168.67.255)</li>
</ol>
<p>Hosts up: 1 (the scanning host itself at 192.168.67.195)</p>
<p>Open ports found: None on the scanning host.</p>
<p>Nmap scan report for 192.168.67.195 Host is up (0.0000030s latency).
All 1000 scanned ports on 192.168.67.195 are closed.</p>
<p>No other hosts responded to the scan on this subnet.</p>
<p>Wireshark capture showed outgoing SYN packets to scanned IPs, with
RST responses indicating closed ports.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Analysis The scan host (192.168.67.195) has no open TCP ports in the
scanned range.</li>
</ol>
<p>No other devices on the network responded, likely due to:</p>
<p>Network client isolation or firewall restrictions.</p>
<p>Other devices may have host-based firewalls blocking probes.</p>
<p>Possible network segmentation.</p>
<p>The absence of open ports reduces the immediate risk of remote
network attacks on this host.</p>
<p>Common ports typically scanned (22, 80, 443, etc.) were closed,
indicating limited network exposure.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Common Services and Security Risks (If Ports Were Open) Port
Service Common Risks 22 SSH Weak passwords, open root login 80/443
HTTP/HTTPS Outdated software, unpatched vulnerabilities 445 SMB
Exploitable vulnerabilities (e.g., EternalBlue) 3306 MySQL Weak
authentication, exposed databases</p></li>
<li><p>Conclusion This scan demonstrated the use of Nmap to enumerate
network hosts and open ports. The network shows limited exposure, with
no open ports detected on the scanning host and no visible devices on
the subnet.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Further steps could include:</p>
<p>Verifying network isolation or firewall policies.</p>
<p>Scanning during different network conditions.</p>
<p>Expanding to UDP scans or vulnerability scanning tools.</p>
